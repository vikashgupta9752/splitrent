# Shared Expenses Manager

A complete, production-ready web application designed for managing shared flatmate expenses. It implements a clean, modular architecture using **React.js** (frontend) and **Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL/MySQL** (backend). It features dynamic membership history tracking, multiple currency support (INR/USD), a robust debt simplification engine, and a CSV import module with automated anomaly detection.

## 1. Project Overview & Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, logout, and protected route access.
- **Dynamic Group Membership**: Support for historical group memberships. A member's join/leave dates are recorded; expenses occurring outside their active membership window do not affect their balance.
- **Detailed Balance Traceability**: A clear, audit-ready breakdown showing every expense and settlement that contributed to a member's net balance.
- **Multiple Currencies**: Seamlessly record expenses in INR or USD. Converted amounts are calculated using exchange rates and aggregated in INR.
- **Debt Simplification**: A greedy algorithm that minimizes the total number of transactions required to settle the group.
- **CSV Import Engine & Anomaly Detection**: Upload CSV files directly. It parses rows, validates fields, and detects:
  - Duplicate transactions
  - Negative amounts (refunds)
  - Missing currencies (defaults to INR)
  - Invalid dates (normalizes standard formats)
  - Settlements accidentally recorded as expenses
  - Unknown participants (creates guests or maps to existing members)
  - Membership violations

## 3. Getting Started & Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v18+)
2. **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** (or fallback to local SQLite)

### Database Setup
The application dynamically adapts to your database configuration based on the `DATABASE_URL` or `MYSQL_URL` connection strings:
* **PostgreSQL:** Set `DB_DIALECT=postgres` and provide a `DATABASE_URL`.
* **MySQL:** Set `DB_DIALECT=mysql` and provide a `MYSQL_URL` (or standard credentials).
* **SQLite:** Set `DB_DIALECT=sqlite` (great for quick zero-setup local runs).

### Installation & Run Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikashgupta9752/splitrent.git
   cd splitrent
   ```
2. **Run Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   # Create a .env file (see Configuration below)
   npm start
   ```
3. **Run Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   # Create a .env file (see Configuration below)
   npm run dev
   ```

## 4. Environment Variables

### Backend Configuration (`backend/.env`)
Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with the following variables:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Settings (PostgreSQL example)
DB_DIALECT=postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/database

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
```

### Frontend Configuration (`frontend/.env`)
Set the backend API entrypoint:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## 5. Cloud Deployment Architecture

The production environment is split across Vercel and Railway for optimal scalability:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Vercel[Vercel: React Frontend] -->|API Calls| RailwayServer[Railway: Express Backend]
    RailwayServer -->|Sequelize ORM| RailwayDB[(Railway: Managed PostgreSQL)]
```

* **Frontend:** Hosted on Vercel at [splitrent-three.vercel.app](https://splitrent-three.vercel.app). It incorporates a zero-configuration fallback to the production backend URL when built for production.
* **Backend:** Hosted on Railway at [api.splitrent.com](https://api.splitrent.com), running on Node 22.
* **Database:** Hosted on Railway using a managed, high-performance PostgreSQL database.

## 6. AI Development & Agentic Coding
This project was successfully reviewed, refactored, and deployed in collaboration with **Antigravity**, an advanced agentic AI coding assistant developed by Google DeepMind.

**AI Contributions:**
* **PostgreSQL Migration:** Refactored the database engine in `backend/config/db.js` to dynamically support both PostgreSQL and MySQL connection dialects with automatic SSL handling.
* **Deployment Optimization:** Fixed deployment crashes by identifying start command incompatibilities (`./run.sh` vs `npm start`) on Railway and rewriting production fallbacks.
* **Git and Remote Coordination:** Handled local updates, staged changes, and pushed code to GitHub repositories.

## 7. API Documentation

All routes are prefixed with `/api`.

### Auth Routes
* `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user account.
* `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.
* `POST /auth/logout`: Invalidate user session.
* `GET /auth/me`: Get current logged-in user details.

### Group Routes
* `GET /groups`: List all groups the logged-in user belongs to.
* `POST /groups`: Create a new expense group.
* `GET /groups/:id`: Get detailed group info (including members and balances).
* `POST /groups/:id/members`: Add a new member (registered user or guest) with join/leave dates.
* `PUT /groups/:id/members/:memberId`: Edit member details (name, join/leave dates).

### Expense Routes
* `GET /groups/:groupId/expenses`: List all expenses in a group.
* `POST /groups/:groupId/expenses`: Add a new expense (with splits).
* `PUT /expenses/:id`: Update an expense.
